            Have you felt dry and weary from this last season of life? Have you
            been running in your own strength and coming up short? Maybe you've
            found yourself looking for answers and, even in finding them,
            feeling like it's still not satisfying your longing for truth.
          </p>

          <p class="text-primary font-medium text-lg mb-4">
            The answer is this—there is more. More grace. More anointing. More
            truth. More power. But it is only found in the raw, unrelenting
            pursuit of the presence of God.
          </p>
          <p class="text-primary font-medium text-lg mb-4">
            For over 20 years, we have staked our lives on this foundation, that
            above all else, we need to live wholly in God’s presence. More can
            be accomplished as a lover than as a doer, and God is calling you
            back to your first love, and to the simple truths of who He is, who
            He says you are, and how you are called to change the world with
            Him.

            At Open Heavens 2022, we are creating a space for God’s oil to fill
            you once again to overflowing, where there is grace to encounter Him
            without limit. For three days, we will devoutly pursue His presence
            with unashamed love and passion, and gain tools and keys for walking
            out an intimacy that, in its overflow, will change the world.
          </p>
          <p class="text-primary font-medium text-lg mb-4">
            Come and drink from the One who makes every other well run dry
            because He wants to fill you to overflow. Come and be filled again,
            refreshed and restored to walk in the grace of intimacy, and watch
            your life thrive in the way that only God’s presence can cause it
            to.
